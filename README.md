# Personal Portfolio
I've remade my portfolio in Next.js 13 to learn the basics of it. I'd say I've learned quite a lot by "remastering" it.

[This](https://jdichh.netlify.app/) was the previous version made only with HTML, SCSS and JS.

## Revising my Portfolio
<strong>Update (Oct. 12, 2023):</strong> I revised my portfolio by improving file structure, reducing JS usage, and improved theme switching using next-themes. Check out the [repo of it here](https://github.com/jdichh/portfolio-next/).
