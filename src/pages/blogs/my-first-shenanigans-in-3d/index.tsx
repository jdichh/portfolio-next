              During the earlier days of my journey in learning frontend
              development, which started around June 2023, I came across a video
              in my recommended section in YouTube. It was about making a
              portfolio in 3D, with something called{" "}

              So imagine how amused I was at the video YouTube recommended to
              me. I was shocked, but in a positive manner. Because I thought, at
              the time, that frontend was just about React, Vue, Angular, and
              all that jazz. So I took it upon myself to get to know and learn
              how Three.js worked.{" "}

                its ecosystem instead of 3D stuff.

                article by Maxime Heckel

              , on how to create a vaporwave scene with Three.js. This article
              was a great read by the way, as it helped me understand more of
              the complicated stuff like how to regenerate terrain for an
              indefinite amount of time.

              It's a trick used by many games, to give you the illusion that
              there's a huge map during a corridor-style level (like Temple Run,
              remember that?)â€”when in actuality, a part of the map's terrain is
              just regenerated after the camera has passed it. It's like walking
              or running on a treadmill, in simpler terms.

              I followed Maxime's instructions and guidelines, but not blindly.
              I took the time to understand what some things meant, because
              what's the point of tutorials if you're just going to copy code
              for code, and not understand it? Yeah, I'm talking to you, Jason

              Anyway, I didn't want to end the project with a 1:1 copy of his
              work; I wanted to add more things, like a sun, a skybox,
              background music, some postprocessing effects like bloom and a CRT
              filter, and maybe some other tweaks if I found the need to act
              upon them. So I made sure to accomplish these tasks that I set for
              myself.

              This was my "eureka" moment. It suddenly hit me, why not just make

              So I created an image to be used as a texture. The initial

              orange. But after creating the texture, I thought that it looked
              quite apocalyptic, and wasn't the "vibe" I was going for. So I
              switched to cooler colors, and I added some stars too.
